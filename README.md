## üåü Overview

**DNAT (From Nothing to Everything)** is a project with organized and accessible
documentation, built using [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/), a modern
and efficient static site generator. The main objective of this project is to
provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use documentation platform, allowing users
to access detailed information about crypto, blockchain, security, and much
more.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### 1. Adding Pages

To add new pages to the documentation, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `src/` folder, where there's a folder for each supported
   language.
2. Choose the desired language and enter `docs`, which is the folder where
   content should be added:
   - Create a new folder with the desired page name.
   - Or create a `.md` file inside an existing folder, always respecting the
     folder hierarchy.
3. Add content in **Markdown** format.
4. Update the `.vitepress/locales/<locale>.ts` file to include the new page path
   in the sidebar.

### 2. Translations

To translate content to new languages:

1. Edit files in `.vitepress/locales/`.
2. Keep keys synchronized between languages to ensure consistency.
3. Update the `config.ts` file to include the new language if necessary.

## üìã Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to keep documentation organized and consistent:

- **Organization by themes:** Create thematic folders inside `src/locale/docs/`
  to group related pages.
- **Updated translations:** Whenever adding or modifying content, ensure all
  translations are synchronized.
- **Established standards:** Follow the style and conventions already defined in
  the project to ensure uniformity.

### üîç Markdown Usage Example

#### Nested Lists

Use nested lists to organize hierarchical information:

```markdown
- Main Category
  - Subcategory 1
    - Item 1
    - Item 2
  - Subcategory 2
```

#### Tables

Tables are useful for organizing tabular information:

| Command         | Description                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `npm install`   | Installs dependencies         |
| `npm run dev`   | Starts development server     |
| `npm run build` | Builds project for production |

#### Code Blocks

Use code blocks to highlight commands or examples:

```javascript
const message = 'Hello, world!';
console.log(message);
```
